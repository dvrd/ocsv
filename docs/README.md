## Migration Complete âœ…

All major documentation has been migrated to the new hierarchical structure. The flat structure has been replaced with a clear 6-category system for better navigation and discoverability.

---

## What Changed (2025-10-15)

The documentation has been reorganized from a flat structure (48 files in `docs/`) to a hierarchical structure for better navigation:

**Before:**
- 48 markdown files in one folder
- Hard to find related documents
- PRP results mixed with user guides
- Duplicate/obsolete files

**After:**
- 6 clear categories (01-06)
- User-facing docs separated from internals
- Historical PRPs archived (28 files)
- Obsolete/duplicate files removed (11 files)
- README in each category

**Key Improvements:**
- âœ… ~75% reduction in root files (48 â†’ 12 active)
- âœ… Clear navigation hierarchy
- âœ… All PRPs archived (28 documents)
- âœ… Consolidated SIMD documentation (3 â†’ 1)
- âœ… Removed duplicate summaries (3 files)
- âœ… Removed obsolete PRP specs (8 files)
- âœ… Organized all docs into proper categories
