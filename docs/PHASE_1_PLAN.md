## Technical Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Linux validation** - Most common server platform
2. **Windows validation** - Desktop/enterprise use
3. **CI/CD automation** - Prevent regressions
4. **npm publishing** - Easy installation

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance profiling** - Identify real bottlenecks
2. **Documentation polish** - Improve clarity
3. **Examples repository** - Real-world use cases

### Low Priority
1. **Community engagement** - Nice to have but not blocking
2. **Tutorial videos** - Can be added later

---

## Known Issues to Address

### From Phase 0
1. **State machine duplication** - Parser vs streaming (~200 lines)
   - **Priority:** Medium (technical debt)
   - **Action:** Refactor in Phase 2 (not blocking)

2. **Limited error details** - `parse_csv()` returns bool only
   - **Priority:** Low (streaming has callbacks)
   - **Action:** Add `parse_csv_with_errors()` variant in Phase 2

3. **SIMD performance gap** - 13% slower than scalar
   - **Priority:** Low (overall performance excellent)
   - **Action:** Document, possibly revisit in Phase 3

---

## Performance Optimization Ideas (PRP-16)

### 1. Branch Reduction
**Current Issue:** State machine has many branches in hot loop.
**Approach:**
- Use lookup tables for character classification
- Reduce if/else chains with switch statements
- Eliminate redundant checks

**Expected Gain:** 5-10%

### 2. Memory Access Patterns
**Current Issue:** Field buffer may cause cache misses.
**Approach:**
- Preallocate larger buffers
- Use arena allocators for temporary data
- Reduce allocations in hot paths

**Expected Gain:** 5-10%

### 3. Small File Optimization
**Current Issue:** Overhead dominates for small files.
**Approach:**
- Fast path for files < 1KB
- Skip unnecessary initialization
- Use stack buffers for small data

**Expected Gain:** 20-30% for small files

### 4. String Operations
**Current Issue:** `strings.clone()` allocates frequently.
**Approach:**
- Consider string interning for repeated values
- Use string pool for common strings
- Reduce unnecessary clones

**Expected Gain:** 5-15% depending on data
