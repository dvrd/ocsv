## Executive Summary

CISV is a high-performance CSV parser built in C with SIMD optimizations (AVX2/AVX-512) and Node.js bindings. It achieves competitive performance (71-104 MB/s) but is currently **NOT production-ready** due to incomplete RFC 4180 edge case handling.

### Current Status

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent performance (competitive with d3-dsv, faster than papaparse)
- ✅ SIMD-optimized parsing with AVX2/AVX-512 support
- ✅ Zero-copy memory mapping
- ✅ Rich transformation API (uppercase, lowercase, trim, base64, SHA256, etc.)
- ✅ Both sync and async APIs
- ✅ CLI tool and Node.js addon
- ✅ TypeScript definitions included

**Critical Limitations:**
- ❌ NOT production-ready (edge cases incomplete)
- ❌ Limited test coverage (only basic.test.js)
- ❌ Linux/Unix only (no Windows support)
- ❌ x86_64 only (no ARM64/NEON optimization)
- ❌ Minimal documentation
- ❌ Basic error handling

### Project Health Metrics

| Metric | Status | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Performance | 71-104 MB/s | ✅ Top 3 |
| Production Ready | ❌ No | 🎯 Yes |
| Test Coverage | ~20% | 🎯 >95% |
| Platform Support | Linux/Unix only | 🎯 Win+Mac+Linux+ARM |
| Documentation | Basic | 🎯 Comprehensive |

```
cisv_parser.c (40KB)      - Main parser with SIMD optimizations
cisv_simd.h               - SIMD detection (AVX-512/AVX2/fallback)
cisv_transformer.c (18KB) - Data transformations
cisv_writer.c (16KB)      - CSV writing with SIMD
```

**2. Node.js Integration**
```
cisv_addon.cc (34KB)      - N-API bindings
index.{js,mjs,ts}         - JavaScript/TypeScript wrappers
```

**3. Build System**
```
Makefile                  - CLI compilation
binding.gyp               - node-gyp configuration
```

### Performance Characteristics

**Benchmark Results:**

| Library | Sync (MB/s) | Async (MB/s) | Relative Speed |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| cisv | 71-104 | 27-98 | **1.0x** |
| d3-dsv | 96-98 | N/A | **1.1x faster** |
| udsv | 69 | 51-53 | 0.95x |
| papaparse | 28 | 21 | **0.35x (2.8x slower)** |
| csv-parse | 18 | N/A | **0.25x (4x slower)** |
| fast-csv | N/A | 10 | 0.37x |

**Key Observations:**
- Competitive with best-in-class parsers
- d3-dsv slightly faster in sync mode
- Significant performance drop with data access (98→27 MB/s async)
- 2-4x faster than popular libraries (papaparse, csv-parse)

### SIMD Optimizations

**Current Implementation:**
- AVX-512 support (64-byte vectors) on compatible CPUs
- AVX2 fallback (32-byte vectors)
- Scalar fallback for non-x86 architectures
- SIMD used for:
  - Delimiter detection
  - Quote character scanning
  - Newline detection

**Optimization Flags:**
```bash
-O3 -march=native -mavx2 -mtune=native
-flto -ffast-math -funroll-loops
```

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Blocking Production)

#### 1. RFC 4180 Edge Cases
**Current State:** Partial compliance
**Missing:**
- Complex nested quotes handling
- Multiline field edge cases
- Mixed quote styles in single field
- Comment lines within quoted fields

**Example Issues:**
```csv
# These may fail:
"Field with ""nested"" quotes and
multiple lines"
"Mix of 'quotes' and ""escapes"""
# Comment inside "quoted field"
```

**Impact:** Cannot be used in production for untrusted CSV files

#### 2. Test Coverage
**Current State:** ~20% coverage (basic.test.js only)
**Missing:**
- Edge case test suite
- Fuzzing harness
- Property-based tests
- Integration tests
- Performance regression tests
- Memory leak tests

**Impact:** No confidence in correctness, high regression risk

#### 3. Platform Support
**Current State:** Linux/Unix only
**Missing:**
- Windows support (different memory mapping API)
- ARM64/NEON SIMD optimizations
- macOS-specific optimizations

**Impact:** Limits potential user base by ~40%

### High-Priority Gaps

#### 4. Documentation
**Current State:** README only (~450 lines)
**Missing:**
- Architecture documentation
- API reference (comprehensive)
- Cookbook with advanced patterns
- Migration guides
- Contributing guide
- Performance tuning guide

**Impact:** Slow adoption, high support burden

#### 5. Error Handling
**Current State:** Basic error codes
**Missing:**
- Detailed error messages with context
- Error recovery strategies
- Partial parsing mode
- Error callbacks
- Validation reporting

**Impact:** Difficult to debug in production

### Medium-Priority Gaps

#### 6. Advanced Features
**Missing:**
- Schema validation
- Type inference
- Multi-threaded parsing
- Memory optimization modes
- Advanced transformations
- Plugin architecture

**Impact:** Limited enterprise adoption
