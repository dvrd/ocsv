# PRP-16 Phase 1 Results: SIMD Integration

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**
**Performance Gain:** **+42% average throughput**

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 of PRP-16 successfully integrated SIMD optimizations into the CSV parser, achieving a **42% performance improvement** (27.62 → 39.29 MB/s) across all file sizes. The implementation maintains exact RFC 4180 compliance and passes all existing tests.

**Key Achievement:** Root cause identified and fixed - parser was not using SIMD functions despite having a complete implementation.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **`src/parser_simd.odin`** - Rewrote SIMD parser
   - Previously: Empty stub that delegated to scalar parser
   - Now: Full SIMD implementation using ARM NEON intrinsics
   - Uses `find_any_special_simd()` to skip over unquoted field content (16 bytes/cycle)
   - Uses `find_quote_simd()` to skip over quoted field content (16 bytes/cycle)
   - Maintains exact same state machine logic as scalar parser

2. **`src/parser.odin`** - Updated main parser
   - `parse_csv()` now calls `parse_csv_auto()` (automatically uses SIMD)
   - Original implementation renamed to `parse_csv_scalar()` (kept for comparison)
   - No API changes - existing code works without modification

3. **Architecture Detection** (`parse_csv_auto()`)
   - ARM64: Always use SIMD (NEON is fast, no overhead)
   - x86_64: Use SIMD for files > 1KB (scalar for tiny files)
   - Other: Fallback to scalar

### SIMD Strategy

**Fast Path for Unquoted Fields** (`.In_Field` state):
```odin
// Instead of byte-by-byte iteration:
for ch in data { /* check each byte */ }

// SIMD skips to next special character:
next_pos, found_byte := find_any_special_simd(data_bytes, delimiter, '\n', i)
// Processes 16 bytes per SIMD instruction
```

**Fast Path for Quoted Fields** (`.In_Quoted_Field` state):
```odin
// Instead of byte-by-byte:
for ch in data { if ch == quote { break } }

// SIMD skips to next quote:
next_quote := find_quote_simd(data_bytes, quote, i)
// Processes 16 bytes per SIMD instruction
```

**Result:** Parser spends most of its time in SIMD bulk-copy loops instead of branch-heavy character-by-character checks.

## Analysis

### Why Only 42% and Not 3-5x?

Original hypothesis was 3-5x improvement (80-150 MB/s). Actual result is 1.42x (39.29 MB/s).

**Remaining Bottlenecks:**

1. **Field Buffer Operations** (High Impact)
   - Still doing byte-by-byte appends: `for j in i..<next_pos { append(&field_buffer, b) }`
   - Should use bulk copy: `append_elems(&field_buffer, ..data_bytes[i:next_pos])`
   - **Expected gain**: +20-30%

2. **String Cloning** (High Impact)
   - Every field: `strings.clone(field)` → heap allocation + copy
   - Could use arena allocator or string views
   - **Expected gain**: +20-40%

3. **UTF-8 Decoding Overhead** (Medium Impact)
   - Still decoding UTF-8 for non-ASCII characters
   - Could optimize for ASCII-only CSVs (90% of use cases)
   - **Expected gain**: +10-15%

4. **State Machine Transitions** (Low Impact)
   - Switch statements at every character boundary
   - Could batch state transitions
   - **Expected gain**: +5-10%

### Why Performance is Consistent?

All file sizes show ~42% improvement because:
- SIMD is now engaged for all files > 1KB
- Tiny files (< 1KB) also improved (+42%) despite being "too small for SIMD" threshold
- Indicates SIMD overhead is minimal on ARM64

## Phase 2 Optimization Opportunities

### High Priority (Expected +40-60%)

1. **Bulk Copy Field Content**
   - Replace byte-by-byte append with `append_elems()`
   - Estimated gain: +20-30%
   - Risk: Low (straightforward change)

2. **Arena Allocator for Strings**
   - Replace `strings.clone()` with arena allocation
   - Estimated gain: +20-40%
   - Risk: Medium (memory management complexity)

3. **ASCII Fast Path**
   - Detect ASCII-only CSVs and skip UTF-8 decoding
   - Estimated gain: +10-15%
   - Risk: Low (fallback to UTF-8 if needed)

### Medium Priority (Expected +10-20%)

4. **Preallocate Field Buffer**
   - Reserve typical field size (256 bytes) upfront
   - Estimated gain: +5-10%
   - Risk: Low (more memory usage)

5. **Optimize Empty Field Detection**
   - Fast path for consecutive delimiters (`,,,`)
   - Estimated gain: +5-10%
   - Risk: Low (specific use case)

### Low Priority (Expected +5-10%)

6. **Lookup Table for Character Classification**
   - 256-byte table for delimiter/quote/newline checks
   - Estimated gain: +2-5%
   - Risk: Low (simple optimization)

7. **Inline Hot Functions**
   - Force inline `emit_field()`, `emit_row()`
   - Estimated gain: +2-5%
   - Risk: Low (compiler hint)

## Phase 2 Target

**Current:** 39.29 MB/s
**Phase 2 Target:** 80-100 MB/s (+100-150% from Phase 1)
**Stretch Goal:** 120+ MB/s (Phase 0 parity with 158 MB/s claim)

### Projected Results

With all Phase 2 optimizations:

| Benchmark | Phase 1 | Phase 2 (Conservative) | Phase 2 (Optimistic) |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|----------------------|

| Small | 36 MB/s | 70 MB/s | 100 MB/s |
| Medium | 39 MB/s | 80 MB/s | 120 MB/s |
| Large | 39 MB/s | 90 MB/s | 140 MB/s |
| **Average** | **39 MB/s** | **75 MB/s (+91%)** | **110 MB/s (+180%)** |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Root Cause Analysis is Critical**
   - Spent time profiling before optimizing
   - Discovered SIMD functions existed but were never called
   - Avoided premature optimization

2. **SIMD Integration is Straightforward**
   - Used existing SIMD functions (`find_*_simd()`)
   - Changed loop from `for ch in data` to manual indexing
   - Maintained state machine logic unchanged

3. **42% is Good, But Not Enough**
   - SIMD alone isn't sufficient for 3-5x gains
   - Need to address memory allocation and string operations
   - Phase 2 optimizations are necessary

4. **ARM NEON is Fast**
   - Even tiny files (100 rows) benefit from SIMD
   - No measurable overhead on ARM64
   - Always-on SIMD is viable for this architecture

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 Successfully Completed:** SIMD integration achieved **42% performance improvement** (27.62 → 39.29 MB/s) with no loss of RFC 4180 compliance or test coverage.

**Root Cause Fixed:** Parser now uses SIMD functions that were previously implemented but never called.

**Phase 2 Opportunity:** Additional optimizations (bulk copy, arena allocator, ASCII fast path) can achieve **2-3x further improvement** (target: 80-120 MB/s).

**Status:** Ready for Phase 2 implementation.
