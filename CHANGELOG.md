## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-09

### ⚡ Performance

**Phase 3: JavaScript Deserialization Optimization (Production)**

This major performance update brings OCSV to **56% of native Odin performance** through optimized JavaScript deserialization. Phase 3 is the production version after evaluating multiple optimization approaches (Phases 4-6) that did not improve performance.

### Added
- **Optimized Deserializer** (`bindings/index.js`)
  - `_deserializePackedBufferOptimized()` - New high-performance deserializer
  - Batched TextDecoder with single reused instance (-30% decoder overhead)
  - Pre-allocated arrays (reduced GC pressure)
  - SIMD-friendly sequential memory access patterns
  - Row size adaptive strategy (<4KB batched, >4KB individual)
- **Performance Benchmarks**
  - `test-phase3-performance.js` - Comprehensive benchmark suite
  - `test-phase3-integration.js` - Integration test suite
  - `PHASE3-SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation documentation

### Performance Results

**Test Setup:** 100K rows × 12 fields, 13.80 MB CSV file

```
Mode              Throughput    vs Native      Improvement
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Native Odin       109.28 MB/s   100%           (baseline)
Phase 3 Optimized 61.25 MB/s    56.1%          +17.1% vs P2
Phase 2 Packed    52.32 MB/s    47.9%          +30.0% vs P1
Phase 1 Bulk JSON 40.68 MB/s    37.2%          (baseline)
Field-by-Field    29.58 MB/s    27.1%          N/A
```

**Key Achievements:**
- ⚡ **61.25 MB/s average** (56% of native Odin, 109 MB/s baseline)
- 📈 **+17.1% faster** than Phase 2 (52.32 → 61.25 MB/s)
- 🚀 **~444,444 rows/second** processing speed
- ✅ **Simple implementation** - No complex SIMD, maintainable code
- 💡 **Pragmatic approach** - JavaScript optimizations only, significant FFI overhead remains

**Note:** Original PRP incorrectly used 61.84 MB/s as baseline. Actual native Odin performance is ~109 MB/s on same dataset. Phase 3 achieves 56% of native, indicating substantial FFI/serialization overhead that requires further optimization.

### Technical Optimizations

**JavaScript-Side Improvements:**
1. **Batched TextDecoder** - Reused single decoder instance reduces overhead by ~30%
2. **Pre-allocated Arrays** - All output arrays sized upfront, eliminates dynamic growth
3. **SIMD-Friendly Patterns** - Sequential memory access for better CPU cache utilization
4. **Adaptive Processing** - Small rows (<4KB) batched, large rows individual for optimal performance

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Zero breaking changes - fully backward compatible
- Phase 2 deserializer preserved as fallback
- All existing tests still passing (36 pass, 1 skip)
- Clean, maintainable code without native SIMD complexity

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with Phase 3 performance metrics
- Added PHASE3-SUMMARY.md with complete implementation details
- Updated performance comparison tables across all documentation

### Notes
- Phase 3 achieved 61.25 MB/s average (56% of native 109.28 MB/s)
- This represents the practical limit for JavaScript FFI-based approach
- Remaining 44% overhead is fundamental to FFI boundary (serialization/deserialization)
- Ready for production - pragmatic, maintainable approach with strong performance

### Attempted Further Optimizations (Phases 4-6)
The following optimizations were implemented and benchmarked but **did not improve performance**:
- ❌ **Phase 4: ASCII Fast Path** (60.15 MB/s, -2%) - latin1 decoder only 11% faster, not 3× as expected
- ❌ **Phase 5: UTF-16 Pre-transcoding** (30.72 MB/s, -50%) - Transcoding overhead too high, buffer doubled
- ❌ **Phase 6: ARM NEON SIMD** (51.31 MB/s, -16%) - Chunking without real SIMD added overhead

**Conclusion:** Phase 3 represents the optimal FFI-based solution. Further improvements would require fundamentally different architectures (native addons, WASM, etc.).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### ⚡ Performance

**Phase 2: Packed Buffer FFI Optimization - Zero-Copy Deserialization**

This major performance update introduces packed binary buffer serialization for minimal FFI overhead and maximum throughput.

### Added
- **Packed Buffer Serialization** (`src/ffi_bindings.odin`)
  - Binary format with 24-byte header (magic, version, metadata)
  - Row offset array for O(1) random access
  - Length-prefixed UTF-8 strings (u16 + data)
  - Little-endian encoding throughout
- **Zero-Copy Deserialization** (`bindings/simple.ts`)
  - `parseCSVPacked()` - New high-performance parsing function
  - Direct ArrayBuffer access with `toArrayBuffer()`
  - Efficient DataView + TextDecoder deserialization
- **Memory Management**
  - Added `packed_buffer` field to Parser struct
  - Automatic cleanup in `parser_destroy()`
  - Memory stored in Parser for proper lifecycle management
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks** (`examples/benchmark_bulk.ts`)
  - Three-way comparison: field-by-field vs JSON vs packed buffer
  - Performance ratings against native Odin baseline
  - Data validation across all modes

### Performance Results

**Test Setup:** 100K rows, 12.71 MB CSV file

```
Mode              Throughput    ns/row    vs Baseline    Speedup
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Native Odin       61.84 MB/s    -         100%           -
Packed Buffer     52.32 MB/s    2,238     84.6% ⭐       1.77×
Bulk JSON         40.68 MB/s    2,878     65.8%          1.38×
Field-by-Field    29.58 MB/s    3,957     47.8%          1.00×
```

**Key Achievements:**
- ⚡ **52.32 MB/s** throughput (84.6% of native Odin performance)
- 🚀 **1.77× faster** than field-by-field FFI access
- 📈 **1.29× faster** than Phase 1 JSON serialization (40.68 → 52.32 MB/s)
- 🎯 **Single FFI call** instead of N×M individual calls
- 💾 **Zero-copy** memory access with ArrayBuffer
- ✅ **100% data validation** - all tests pass

### Technical Details

**Binary Format Specification:**
```
Header (24 bytes):
  0-3:   magic (0x4F435356 "OCSV")
  4-7:   version (1)
  8-11:  row_count (u32)
  12-15: field_count (u32)
  16-23: total_bytes (u64)

Row Offsets (row_count × 4 bytes):
  24+i*4: offset to row i data

Field Data (variable length):
  [length: u16][UTF-8 bytes]
```

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Uses `core:encoding/endian` for consistent byte order
- Efficient `calculate_packed_buffer_size()` for pre-allocation
- Modular helpers: `write_header()`, `write_row_offsets()`, `write_field_data()`
- Export: `ocsv_rows_to_packed_buffer()` FFI function

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with FFI Performance Optimization section
- Added comprehensive benchmark results and usage examples
- Documented when to use packed buffer mode vs other modes

### Notes
- Phase 2 target was 55 MB/s (89% of baseline)
- Achieved 52.32 MB/s (84.6% of baseline) - within 5% of target
- "GOOD" performance rating (within 20% of native Odin baseline)
- Ready for production use in performance-critical applications
