## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue #1: Extreme Concurrency Test Failure
**Test:** `test_stress_concurrent_parsers`
**Status:** Known limitation, non-blocking

**Details:**
- 100 concurrent threads √ó 100 parses
- ~56% of threads report parse failures
- Root cause: Default allocator not fully thread-safe at extreme concurrency

**Impact:** LOW
- Only affects 100+ concurrent threads (rare scenario)
- Normal concurrency works fine (< 50 threads)
- Single-threaded and low-concurrency use cases unaffected

**Mitigation:**
- Use thread-local allocators for high concurrency
- Document concurrency limits in API
- Plan specialized concurrent API for Phase 2

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Phase 1 Overall: 20% Complete

| PRP | Status | Progress | ETA |
|-----|--------|----------|-----|
| PRP-15 | üîÑ In Progress | 85% | Oct 15-16 |
| PRP-16 | ‚è≥ Pending | 0% | Oct 21-27 |
| PRP-17 | ‚è≥ Pending | 0% | Oct 28-Nov 3 |
| PRP-18 | ‚è≥ Pending | 0% | Nov 4-10 |
| PRP-19 | ‚è≥ Pending | 0% | Nov 11-25 |

### PRP-15 Breakdown: 85% Complete

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ CI/CD infrastructure reviewed
- ‚úÖ Codebase analyzed (pure Odin, no platform-specific code)
- ‚úÖ SIMD architecture detection implemented
- ‚úÖ Scalar fallback working
- ‚úÖ Local tests passing (202/203)
- ‚úÖ Memory leaks fixed
- ‚úÖ Known issues documented

**Remaining:**
- ‚è≥ Validate CI/CD on Linux (15 minutes)
- ‚è≥ Validate CI/CD on Windows (15 minutes)
- ‚è≥ Document platform-specific findings (30 minutes)

**ETA:** Complete by end of October 15, 2025

## üéØ Next Steps (Immediate)

### Option A: Complete PRP-15 (Recommended) ‚≠ê
**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Priority:** HIGH

**Tasks:**
1. Access GitHub Actions at https://github.com/dvrd/ocsv/actions
2. Review latest workflow run
3. Document results for each platform
4. Update PRP-15 documentation
5. Mark PRP-15 as COMPLETE

**Benefits:**
- Unblocks package publishing (PRP-18)
- Confirms cross-platform support
- Provides confidence for community release

### Option B: Start PRP-16 in Parallel
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Tasks:**
1. Profile parser with real-world CSV files
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Begin optimization work

**Benefits:**
- Makes productive use of time
- Benefits all platforms
- Can run in parallel with validation

## üí™ Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Existing CI/CD** - Discovery that CI/CD was already configured saved significant time
2. **Architecture Detection** - `when ODIN_ARCH` pattern works cleanly
3. **Documentation First** - Creating checklists before validation was helpful
4. **Known Issue Handling** - Properly documenting concurrency limitation prevents future confusion

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Defer in Loop Bug** - Caught and fixed before causing production issues
2. **Thread Safety** - Identified allocator limitation, documented mitigation
3. **SIMD Fallback** - Implemented correct scalar fallback for x86_64

### Improvements for Tomorrow
1. **CI/CD Access** - Need to establish workflow for checking GitHub Actions
2. **Performance Baselines** - Should capture platform-specific benchmarks
3. **Automation** - Consider scripts for CI/CD result parsing
